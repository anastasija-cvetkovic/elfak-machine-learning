# Assignment 1 — Supervised Learning (Regression)

This assignment focuses on supervised learning using regression on a biology-related dataset from Kaggle.
The work includes data preprocessing and exploratory analysis, training and comparing multiple regression models,
hyperparameter tuning, model interpretability (feature importance, LIME, SHAP), and evaluation.
